1. Firstly, install the necessary modules and dependencies by typing the command npx create-expo-app-<your-desired-name> in the terminal and press enter.
2. Once all the modules are install run the command npm run start and it will generate a QR code and a localhost url within the terminal.
3. You need to install Expo Go App from local App Store/Play Store to get started. In case of IOS devices use the stock camera to open the application. For Android devices, use QR scanner embedded in the Expo Go app to start the application.
4. If you want to access it over the web, use the localhost url generated in the terminal.
5. Since all the packages are embedded in the code itself, there would be no need to import them again.
